Notes on Github version control

To make a local git repository:
1 - make a directory on the desktop (mkdir Name)
2 - move into that directory (cd Name)
3 - Initialise Name as a git repository (git init)

After making changes to a file and saving it we need to:
1 - add the file to a 'staging area' where files are watched by git (git add Name)
2 - when you're ready add the changes to the repository as a group (git commit)

Checking the changes you've made:
1 - 'git diff' lists changes between the unadded file and the repository
2 - 'git diff --staged' changes between repository and staged version
